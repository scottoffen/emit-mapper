In order to use Emit Mapper for mapping DbDatareader to objects it is neccesary to develop custom configurator which should define the custom value getter. This custom value getter extracts values from datareader using some naming strategy (for example this strategy can be based on attributes or just on names of fields from the destination object). It will be useful if such mapper had possibility to reproduce DbReader as IEnumerable<T>. The code which demonstrates this can be fount [here](http://emitmapper.codeplex.com/sourcecontrol/changeset/view/41844?projectName=emitmapper#691153).
