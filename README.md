EmitMapper
===========

This is a copy of the [EmitMapper project found on the now-defunct codeplex](http://emitmapper.codeplex.com/). When last I checked, the [most recent release](https://www.nuget.org/packages/EmitMapper/) on Nuget.org was 1.0.0 on July 17, 2011.
My purpose of having this repository here is primarily for my own learning.

## Project Description ##
Powerful customisable tool for mapping entities to each other. Entities can be plain objects, DataReaders, SQL commands and anything you need. The tool uses run-time code generation via the Emit library. It is usefull for dealing with DTO objects, data access layers an so on.
